# Shashank Kamble — Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with React and Three.js.  
It focuses on clean design, subtle motion, and a scroll-driven 3D hero element.

## Tech Stack

- React  
- Vite  
- Three.js (via @react-three/fiber & @react-three/drei)  
- Vercel (deployment)

## What’s Inside

- Scroll-controlled 3D TorusKnot hero  
- Custom lighting and material tuning (desktop & mobile)  
- Smooth reveal animations using IntersectionObserver  
- Interactive hover cards  
- Responsive layout with mobile-specific adjustments  

The goal wasn’t to make something flashy — just something intentional, smooth, and well-balanced.
